Distribution models:
* each client has whole dataset
* each client has a part of dataset

TIME:
* bag_of_words:
for each document -> list appent -> sort whole list -> ~0.19s
for each document -> heappush -> create whole list -> ~0.25
for each document -> heappush -> take first N -> ~0.19s
for each term -> dictionary[document_id] = bag_value -> 0.0s (selected model)

csr_matrix -> keep memory under control
